Forked from https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Constraint_Satisfaction

Implemented the following functions in Jupyter notebook for the Backtracking Search algorithm using symbolic constraints to solve the Constraint Satisfaction N-Queen Problem:
1. __init__ in NQueensCSP to initialise constraints for an N-Sized board
2. is_complete() in NQueensCSP to check if an assignment is consistent and satisfy all constraints
3. is_consistent() in NQueensCSP to check for consistency of a proposed variable assignment
4. backtrack() to perform backtracking search for a valid assignment to a CSP

To be added:
1. inference() in NQueensCSP to perform forward checking


To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Constraint_Satisfaction.ipynb
